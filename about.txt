# BeirutPoly 🎲🇱🇧  
*A Monopoly-inspired board game based on the vibrant city of Beirut*

**BeirutPoly** is a localized, Beirut-themed version of the classic Monopoly board game. Just like Monopoly, it revolves around buying, trading, and developing properties — but instead of Atlantic City or generic locations, **BeirutPoly** brings the heart of **Beirut** to the board.

Players can purchase and develop iconic neighborhoods like **Hamra**, **Achrafieh**, **Mar Mikhael**, **Verdun**, and **Gemmayzeh**. Instead of traditional houses and hotels, properties can be upgraded with **cafés**, **pubs**, **rooftop lounges**, or **luxury apartments**.

The **Chance** and **Community Chest** cards are also locally inspired. You might:

- Lose money due to a **traffic jam on the Corniche**
- Win a bonus from a **dabke flash mob in Downtown**
- Pay a fee for **generator maintenance**
- Or even skip a turn during a **power outage**

BeirutPoly captures the **charm, culture, and chaos** of living in Beirut — from real estate booms and social scenes to street food and unexpected surprises.

It’s fun, competitive, and full of local flavor — perfect for both **locals** and **visitors** who want to experience the spirit of Beirut in a playful, nostalgic way.
